groceryapp-ios
==============

iOS app for grocery tracker

CocoaPods
=========

This project uses CocoaPods for dependency management. It's simple to use and super useful. To install, run the following commands:

1. [sudo] gem install cocoapods
2. pod setup
3. cd /path/to/repo
4. pod install (the pods are included in the repo and should usually be up to date, but may need to be updated from time to time)
5. open groceryApp.xcworkspace (note that you always need to open this file from now on instead of the .xcodeproj file)
6. Enjoy (not a command)
